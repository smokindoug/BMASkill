BMA Alexa skill.

Alexa skill for the [Bytown Motorcycle Association](http://bma1.ca/)'s volunteer hour recording application.

## HowTo
If you have an [Alexa](https://alexa.amazon.ca/) account you can install and use this skill to **add** and **report** your **BMA Volunteer** hours! It will also **report** the number of hours you have in total (only the hours you have used the skill to record).

You must grant the skill access to use your Alexa **Full Name**. This is how the skill identifies you.

You access the skill by (remember to use your Alexa access phrase first):
- open b.m.a.
- ask b.m.a.

Then you can have the skill report hours by saying:
- report hours
- what are my hours

You can also combine opening the skill and reporting hours together:
- ask b.m.a. to report hours
- open b.m.a. and report hours
- ask b.m.a. what are my hours

A number of combinations are available.

To add volunteer hours use phrases like these (after you have accessed the skill as above):
- add entry

The skill will then ask you for the **number** of hours your want to add. Also, it asks for a descripion of the volunteer **task**. The task helps us properly categorize volunteer activity. Once you confirm the entered information, the skill will perform the add and report the new total.

Again, you can combine opening the skill and adding volunteer hours together:
- open b.m.a and add entry
- tell b.m.a. add entry
- open b.m.a. and add entry

## Privacy Policy
The **BMA Alex Skill** uses your **Alexa User Name** to record the hours you add using the skill. It also uses this information to collect the total number of hours that you add using this skill.

No other information is collected.

The collected information is used for the sole purpose of integrating with the internal BMA Motorcycle Association **Volunteer Hour Recording** process.

Please see [Bytown Motorcycle Association](http://bma1.ca) for further information.
