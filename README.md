BMA Alexa skill
Alexa skill for the [Bytown Motorcycle Association](http://bma1.ca/)'s volunteer hour recording application.

##HowTo
If you have an [Alexa](https://alexa.amazon.ca/) account you can install and use this skill to **add** and **report** your **BMA Volunteer** hours! It will also **report** the number of hours you have in total (only the hours you have used the skill to record).

You access the skill by (remember to use your Alexa access phrase first):
- open b.m.a.
- ask b.m.a.

Then you can have the skill report hours by saying:
- report volunteer hours
- what are my hours
- report hours
- hours

You can also combine opening the skill and report hours together:
- ask b.m.a. to report volunteer hours
- open b.m.a. and tell me my hours
- ask b.m.a. hours
- open b.m.a. hours

A good number of combinations are available.
