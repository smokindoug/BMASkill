BMA Alexa skill.

Alexa skill for the [Bytown Motorcycle Association](http://bma1.ca/)'s volunteer hour recording application.

## HowTo
If you have an [Alexa](https://alexa.amazon.ca/) account you can install and use this skill to **add** and **report** your **BMA Volunteer** hours! It will also **report** the number of hours you have in total (only the hours you have used the skill to record).

You must grant the skill access to use your Alexa **Full Name**. This is how the skill identifies you.

You access the skill by (remember to use your Alexa access phrase first):
- open b.m.a.
- ask b.m.a.

Then you can have the skill report hours by saying:
- report volunteer hours
- what are my hours
- report hours
- hours

You can also combine opening the skill and reporting hours together:
- ask b.m.a. to report volunteer hours
- open b.m.a. and tell me my hours
- ask b.m.a. hours
- open b.m.a. hours

A number of combinations are available.

To add volunteer hours use phrases like these (after you have accessed the skill as above):
- add volunteer hours
- add hours
- add

The skill will then ask you for the **number** of hours your want to add. Also, it asks for a descripion of the volunteer **task**. The task helps us properly categorize volunteer activity. Once you confirm the entered information, the skill will perform the add and report the new total.

Again, you can combine opening the skill and adding volunteer hours together:
- open b.m.a, for adding volunteer hours
- ask b.m.a. to add hours

Next, the skill can be used to add volunteer hours to a **designated** volunteer, your riding buddy for example! You can have the skill set the designated volunteer by:
- designate volunteer
- change volunteer
- volunteer

The skill will ask you for the designated volunteer's **first name** and **last name**. You will be asked to confirm. Please ensure accurracy! It makes it difficult for our volunteer hour recorder if the name is mangled. And the hours may not be counted.

And yes, you can combine opening the skill and designating a volunteer in one go:
- ask b.m.a. to change volunteer
- open b.m.a. for volunteer

Once you set the designated volunteer any **add** hours request is added for that designated volunteer. The skill does not currently keep a running total for a designated volunteer (it only keeps the running total for the Alexa user). 

If you use the **cancel** or **stop** requests the skill will reset to no designated volunteer. It will use your Alexa *full name* again as the volunteer (the default). You can also **quite** the skill and **open** again.

Lastly, you can ask the skill to report who the volunteer is:
- who is volunteer
- who is designated volunteer
- who is logged in

## Privacy Policy
The **BMA Alex Skill** uses your **Alexa User Name** to record the hours you add using the skill. It also uses this information to collect the total number of hours that you add using this skill.

No other information is collected.

The collected information is used for the sole purpose of integrating with the internal BMA Motorcycle Association **Volunteer Hour Recording** process.

Please see [Bytown Motorcycle Association](http://bma1.ca) for further information.

Note: the skill will work if Alexa is configured for *Canadian english* or *American english*. French is currently not supported. Add an *issue* if you are interested in helping produce a French version.
